                    <p class="cardContent"> My name is George Clausing. I was born and raised in Marion, Ohio and continue to live here. I currently attend Marion Technical College for a few different programs, and I am hoping to graduate by 2022. Making websites started as
                        a way to pass time, and as I talked to more people about it I started getting requests to make them for people. Once I had done three different sites for people, I decided that I wanted to start making money, and become an offical
                        business, hence the creation of Sindri Websites LLC.

                    <p class="cardContent"> I love playing table top games, whether it be Warhammer 40k, or Dungeons and Dragons I always have a game that I can go to and enjoy greatly. If I'm not doing that I try to keep myself doing something creative, whether it be painting
                        minis for one of the table top games, or working on the lore for a made up world. </p>
